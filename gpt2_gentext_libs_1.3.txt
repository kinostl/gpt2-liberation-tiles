The first real alert came in over the weekend, when a group of around 5 identical turkeys started flying around the room, periodically striking
the players.

The next day, the players have to deal with the strange behavior of the turkeys, including being chased, hopping about, and hopping about randomly, all in the above-the-ground location.

The next day, they have to deal with a Philadelphia professor, a bobcat, and an armored knight, too.

The Mettaurs were a regular fixture on the club bar, and they were sending out colorful fireworks, too.

In 2 full games, the Mettaurs are responsible for most of the game's disruptions.

The prize for winning is a baseball hat, which the players can pick for themselves. The centerplate is also a Challenge reward, for recognizing the players for their hard work. The hat also has a codebreaker: If the alarm panel is off, the players have a bit too much free time, they might get angry...;7 contestants

The ball pit is full of cutlery and fruit bowls. The alarm panel is behind the bar.

The players can hop into the next room and play in it, picking the players their first score. There are also some ordering ways in, like sliding a cake on the table, and then dropping it. The next room and room to go is a bit slower and less fun, depending on the mood of the players.
