The blue Prog is wearing a paper hat.;Mr. Prog won’t let them through! (Though he might change his mind if they prove they’re cool...);Backup - a Champy and Bestplate (two very cool dudes) come out from the club house and attack the players.
The Wall;SyncLock;4;A massive stone wall blocks off the other exits. It’s covered in all kinds of hieroglyphs. The control panel seems to be on the other side of the wall.

Oops. It must be somewhere in the sand... Backup - Viruses burst out of the sand statues! A Mettaur Ω pops out of the sleeping Mettaur, and a Swordy erupts from the knight.
