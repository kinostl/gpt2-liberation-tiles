The Sandbox;CryptoLock;5;An enormous sandbox sits in a room with tall windows. A lone Mr. Prog (with a sand bucket on its head) has had a bit too much free time, and has made several beautiful sand sculptures, including a sleeping Mettaur, a Mr. Prog with a crown, and an armored knight.;Mr. Prog got carried away and buried the alarm panel! Oops. It must be somewhere in the sand... Backup - Viruses burst out of the sand statues! A Mettaur Ω pops out of the sleeping Mettaur, and a Swordy erupts from the knight.
The Clubhouse;ProgLock;4;In a narrow tunnel, a blue Mr. Prog blocks the way and says “You shall not pass! Cool Dudes Club members only!” Behind him, the players can see a messy room, strewn with video games and comic books, along with another Prog or two. The blue Prog is wearing a paper hat.;Mr. Prog won’t let them through! (Though he might change his mind if they prove they’re cool...);Backup - a Champy and Bestplate (two very cool dudes) come out from the club house and attack the players.
The Wall;SyncLock;4;A massive stone wall blocks off the other exits. It’s covered in all kinds of hieroglyphs. The control panel seems to be on the other side of the wall. By deciphering the runes with an Info roll, they find the code to make the wall slide open: “Open source-a-me.” Hazards! First, the ceiling starts to crumble, dropping rocks (Light hazard), and then it begins sliding down to crush the players (Normal hazard).

The Kiosk;N/A;N/A;A NormalNavi’s running a shop here?! They’ve got a small kiosk in a cozy room, with nice mood lighting and comfy bar stools. The GM should pick a few NCPs and BattleChips for the vendor to sell, as well as some fun extra items (e.g. learning a hint, restoring HP, refreshing a chip, getting a compliment).;None!;N/A
